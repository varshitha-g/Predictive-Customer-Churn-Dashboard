# 📊 Predictive Customer Churn Dashboard

This project uses a machine learning model to predict customer churn and visualize risk insights using **Databricks (PySpark + SQL)** and **Tableau**.

## 🔍 What It Shows
- **Churn Probability Distribution:** Model confidence across low, medium, and high risk buckets
- **Actual vs Predicted Churn:** Confusion matrix for performance validation
- **Top At-Risk Customers:** Ranked table to identify high-priority retention targets

## 💡 Technologies Used
- 🧠 **Machine Learning:** Random Forest Classifier
- 💻 **Platform:** Databricks (Community Edition)
- 📈 **Visualization:** Tableau Public
- 💬 **Languages:** PySpark, SQL, Python

## 📁 Data
Based on the Telco Customer Churn dataset (cleaned, encoded, and scored in Databricks)

## 🧪 How I Built It
1. **Data Preprocessing** in PySpark (null handling, encoding, indexing)
2. **Model Training** using Random Forest on Databricks
3. **Prediction Output** exported with churn probability scores
4. **Visualization** in Tableau with interactive filters and KPIs

## 🚀 Use Cases
- Marketing & Customer Retention Strategy
- Data storytelling with predictive analytics
- Demonstrating end-to-end data science workflow
